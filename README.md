## About
OLAF (**O**nline **A**utomated **F**orensics) is an open-source digital forensics tool for public-facing PCs or business desktops or other endpoints, that can classify and audit in near real-time documents and images users downloads or copy to removable storage. OLAF continuosly monitors a PC for activity like downloading or mounting external storage, then extracts the text or image content of files transferred using open-source libraries. Content analysis is then performed on the artifact using different methods inlcuding analysis of images by ML services like Azure Cognitive Services Vision. This information as well as metadata like the date and time a document was downloaded or copied and the user and machine name where the operation occured is logged to Azure Sentinel where it provides a permanent event log of data movement of potential intellectual property or sensitive or PII data, which can then provide evidence of a breach of an organization's policies on information protection.

OLAF helps an organization determine how information flows into and out of their systems when users download files using their web browser or copy files to USB and other removal storage devices and can help enforce policies on using and transferring intellectual property, trade secrets, PII or other sensitive and confidential information. It can also detect when sexual or other inappropriate content from the Internet enters into an organization's systems which may violate computer use policies. OLAF is a open-source standalone program designed to be modular and extendable and can log to any available log target from simple text files to cloud-based SIEM services like Azure Sentinel, without locking an organization into any particular user management or log collection technology.
